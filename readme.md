#Hello
This is a repository of useful scripts for folks who live in the command line and are looking to put therepersonal maching to novel use. So often we use a machine -- in this case our local linux computer -- in simple ways proscribed by the manufacturer. They are capable of much, much more. My goal is to identify small life issues/problems, and write simple scripts that integrate with the functionality of my machine that make life easier or more interesting. 

If you find them useful, please put them to work. I would appreciate if you would leave my comments with attibution intact. 


As the repository grows, this file will be more carefully edited to make it navigable. I'm going to do 0 troubleshooting for folks' indidvidual systems and implementations. If you don't find scripting and problem-solving enjoyable, you're probably better off just hitting up an app store to cobble up similar functionality in your daily life. Probably works better, anyway.
